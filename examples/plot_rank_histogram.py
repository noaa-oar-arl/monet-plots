Rank Histogram
==============

**What it's for:**
The Rank Histogram (also known as a Talagrand diagram) is used to evaluate the reliability
of an ensemble forecast system. It checks whether the observation is equally likely to
fall in any of the "bins" defined by the sorted ensemble members.

**When to use:**
Use this when you have an ensemble of forecasts and a corresponding observation. It is
essential for diagnosing issues with ensemble spread and bias.

**How to read:**
*   **X-axis:** The rank of the observation relative to the sorted ensemble members (0 to N).
*   **Y-axis:** Frequency or relative frequency of occurrences in each rank.
*   **Flat (Uniform):** Indicates a reliable ensemble where the observation is indistinguishable
    from the ensemble members.
*   **U-shape:** Indicates a lack of spread (the ensemble is over-confident; the observation
    frequently falls outside the ensemble range).
*   **Dome shape:** Indicates too much spread (the ensemble is under-confident; the observation
    falls in the middle more often than expected).
*   **Asymmetry (Sloping):** Indicates a systematic bias in the ensemble mean.

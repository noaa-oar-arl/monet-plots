"""
Ensemble Spread-Skill Plot
==========================

**What it's for:**
The Spread-Skill plot evaluates the reliability of an ensemble forecast system by
comparing the ensemble spread (the standard deviation among ensemble members) to
the skill (the actual error, usually RMSE, of the ensemble mean).

**When to use:**
Use this to determine if your ensemble is well-calibrated. A perfectly calibrated
ensemble should have a spread that matches the expected error of the ensemble mean.

**How to read:**
*   **X-axis:** Ensemble Spread.
*   **Y-axis:** Ensemble Skill (RMSE of the mean).
*   **1:1 Line:** Represents a perfectly calibrated ensemble.
*   **Points above the line:** Indicate the ensemble is "under-dispersive" (too
    little spread; the model is overconfident).
*   **Points below the line:** Indicate the ensemble is "over-dispersive" (too
    much spread; the model is under-confident).

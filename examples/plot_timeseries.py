"""
Time Series Plot
================

**What it's for:**
A Time Series plot visualizes how one or more variables change over a continuous
temporal interval.

**When to use:**
Use this for monitoring data, model output at a specific location, or area-averaged
values over time. It is the primary tool for identifying trends, diurnal cycles,
seasonal patterns, and episodic events.

**How to read:**
*   **X-axis:** Represents Time (UTC or local).
*   **Y-axis:** Represents the value of the variable.
*   **Interpretation:** Look for temporal trends, variability, and the timing of
    maximum/minimum values. Multiple lines can be used to compare models against
    observations or different model scenarios.

"""
Scatter Plot with Regression
============================

**What it's for:**
A Scatter Plot visualizes the relationship between two continuous variables. This
implementation often includes a linear regression line to summarize the trend.

**When to use:**
Use this to assess the correlation between model output and observations, or to
explore the relationship between two different physical variables (e.g., temperature
vs. ozone concentration).

**How to read:**
*   **X-axis:** Typically the predictor or independent variable (e.g., Observations).
*   **Y-axis:** Typically the response or dependent variable (e.g., Model).
*   **Regression Line:** Shows the best-fit linear relationship. The slope and
    intercept provide information about systematic bias and scaling.
*   **Interpretation:** The tightness of the point cluster around the line indicates
     the strength of the correlation. Points on the 1:1 diagonal would represent
     a perfect match.

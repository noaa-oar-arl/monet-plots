Wind Barbs Plot
===============

**What it's for:**
A Wind Barbs plot uses standardized meteorological symbols to represent wind
speed and direction at various points on a map.

**When to use:**
Use this when you need a clear, precise representation of wind speed categories
and directions across a geographic region. It is the traditional way to display
wind data on weather maps.

**How to read:**
*   **The Staff:** Points in the direction the wind is blowing *from*.
*   **The Barbs/Flags:** Attached to the end of the staff. Each full barb
    represents 10 units of speed (e.g., knots or m/s), a half-barb is 5 units,
    and a pennant (flag) is 50 units.
*   **Interpretation:** Allows you to quickly assess wind speed and direction
    patterns, identifying features like wind shifts and areas of high wind speeds.

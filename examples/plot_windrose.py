Wind Rose
=========

**What it's for:**
A Wind Rose is a graphical tool used by meteorologists to give a succinct view of how wind
speed and direction are typically distributed at a particular location.

**When to use:**
Use this to characterize the wind climatology of a site. It is critical for siting
wind turbines, designing airport runways, and understanding the dispersion of
pollutants from a local source.

**How to read:**
*   **Direction (Circular/Compass):** The "petals" point toward the direction from which
    the wind is blowing.
*   **Length of Petals:** Indicates the frequency (percentage of time) the wind blows
    from that direction.
*   **Color within Petals:** Represents different wind speed categories (e.g., 0-2 m/s,
    2-5 m/s, etc.).
*   **Interpretation:** A long petal pointing North indicates that the wind frequently
    blows from the North. The distribution of colors within that petal shows the
    distribution of wind speeds for that specific direction.

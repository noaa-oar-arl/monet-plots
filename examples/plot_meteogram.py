Meteogram
=========

**What it's for:**
A Meteogram is a time series plot that displays multiple meteorological variables (e.g.,
temperature, pressure, humidity, wind) for a single geographical location.

**When to use:**
Use this to visualize the evolution of local weather conditions over a specific period.
It is commonly used for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and analyzing site-specific
observational data.

**How to read:**
*   **X-axis:** Represents time (usually UTC or local time).
*   **Y-axes:** Each variable is typically plotted on its own axis or in a stacked sub-plot.
*   **Interpretation:** Look for correlations between variables (e.g., a drop in pressure
    followed by a change in wind direction and temperature, indicating a frontal passage).

Ridgeline Plot
==============

**What it's for:**
A Ridgeline plot (also known as a Joyplot) visualizes the distribution of a continuous
variable across multiple groups by using partially overlapping density plots.

**When to use:**
Use this to compare how a distribution changes over time (e.g., daily profiles for each
month) or across different experimental groups. It is more space-efficient and often
easier to read than multiple overlapping histograms or KDE plots.

**How to read:**
*   **X-axis:** The value of the variable being measured.
*   **Y-axis:** Represents different categories or groups. Each group has its own
    Kernel Density Estimate (KDE).
*   **Interpretation:** Look for shifts in the peak (mean/mode) or the width (spread)
    of the distributions as you move from one group to another.

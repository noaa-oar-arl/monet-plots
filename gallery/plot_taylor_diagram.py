Taylor Diagram
==============

**What it's for:**
The Taylor Diagram provides a concise statistical summary of how well a model (or multiple
models) matches a reference dataset (usually observations). It summarizes three
statistics in a single point: the correlation coefficient, the root-mean-square (RMS)
error, and the standard deviation.

**When to use:**
Use this diagram to compare multiple models or different versions of the same model
against a single set of observations. It is a standard tool in climate and meteorological
model evaluation for assessing spatial or temporal patterns.

**How to read:**
*   **Radial Distance from Origin:** Represents the Standard Deviation of the data.
*   **Angular Coordinate (Arc):** Represents the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R).
*   **Distance from the Reference Point (on the X-axis):** Represents the Centered
    Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error.
*   **Interpretation:** A perfect model would be represented by the "Reference" point
    on the x-axis (Correlation = 1, same Standard Deviation as observations, RMS error = 0).
    The closer a model's point is to the reference point, the better it matches the observations.

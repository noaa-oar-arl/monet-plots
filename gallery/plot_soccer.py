Soccer Plot
===========

**What it's for:**
The Soccer Plot is a summary visualization tool used to evaluate model performance against
predefined benchmarks. It is particularly popular in the air quality modeling community
for comparing results from multiple sites, models, or time periods in a single view.

**When to use:**
Use this plot when you want to quickly communicate whether model performance meets specific
standards (e.g., EPA or industry-standard "Goals" and "Criteria"). It is excellent for
high-level summaries of large datasets.

**How to read:**
*   **X-axis:** Typically represents Mean Bias (MB) or Normalized Mean Bias (NMB).
*   **Y-axis:** Typically represents Mean Error (ME) or Normalized Mean Error (NME).
*   **The "Goal" (Inner Rectangle):** Represents the most stringent performance benchmark.
    Points inside this box are considered excellent.
*   **The "Criteria" (Outer Rectangle):** Represents a standard performance benchmark.
    Points inside this box are considered acceptable.
*   **Interpretation:** Ideally, points should cluster near the bottom-center of the plot
    (low error, low bias), staying within the "Goal" or "Criteria" boxes.

        "\nBrier Decomposition Plot\n========================\n\n**What it's for:**\nThe Brier Score Decomposition plot visualizes the three components of the Brier Score:\nReliability, Resolution, and Uncertainty. The total Brier Score (BS) is calculated as:\nBS = Reliability - Resolution + Uncertainty.\n\n**When to use:**\nUse this to gain a deeper understanding of why a probabilistic forecast system is performing\na certain way. It allows you to distinguish between a model that is poorly calibrated\n(Reliability) and one that lacks the ability to distinguish different outcomes (Resolution).\n\n**How to read:**\n*   **Reliability (Lower is better):** Measures the weighted average of the squared\n    differences between forecast probabilities and the relative frequencies of observed events.\n*   **Resolution (Higher is better):** Measures how much the frequencies of events for\n    specific forecast categories differ from the overall climatological frequency.\n*   **Uncertainty (Fixed for a given set of observations):** Represents the inherent\n    variability of the events being forecast.\n*   **Interpretation:** A perfect model would have a Reliability of 0 and a Resolution\n    equal to the Uncertainty, resulting in a Brier Score of 0.\n"

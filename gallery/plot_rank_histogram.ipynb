        "\nRank Histogram\n==============\n\n**What it's for:**\nThe Rank Histogram (also known as a Talagrand diagram) is used to evaluate the reliability\nof an ensemble forecast system. It checks whether the observation is equally likely to\nfall in any of the \"bins\" defined by the sorted ensemble members.\n\n**When to use:**\nUse this when you have an ensemble of forecasts and a corresponding observation. It is\nessential for diagnosing issues with ensemble spread and bias.\n\n**How to read:**\n*   **X-axis:** The rank of the observation relative to the sorted ensemble members (0 to N).\n*   **Y-axis:** Frequency or relative frequency of occurrences in each rank.\n*   **Flat (Uniform):** Indicates a reliable ensemble where the observation is indistinguishable\n    from the ensemble members.\n*   **U-shape:** Indicates a lack of spread (the ensemble is over-confident; the observation\n    frequently falls outside the ensemble range).\n*   **Dome shape:** Indicates too much spread (the ensemble is under-confident; the observation\n    falls in the middle more often than expected).\n*   **Asymmetry (Sloping):** Indicates a systematic bias in the ensemble mean.\n"

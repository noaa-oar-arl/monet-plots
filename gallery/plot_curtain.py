Curtain Plot
============

**What it's for:**
A Curtain plot (or time-height cross-section) visualizes how a vertical profile changes over
time at a fixed location, or along a moving path (like a flight track).

**When to use:**
Use this to monitor the evolution of the planetary boundary layer, track the arrival and
dispersion of a smoke plume, or analyze the vertical structure of a weather system as it
passes over a station.

**How to read:**
*   **X-axis:** Typically represents Time (or distance along a track).
*   **Y-axis:** Represents Altitude or Pressure.
*   **Color:** Represents the magnitude of the variable being plotted (e.g., PM2.5
    concentration, potential temperature).
*   **Interpretation:** Look for temporal trends at specific heights or the movement of
    features (like an inversion layer) upward or downward over time.

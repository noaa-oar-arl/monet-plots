        "\nWind Rose\n=========\n\n**What it's for:**\nA Wind Rose is a graphical tool used by meteorologists to give a succinct view of how wind\nspeed and direction are typically distributed at a particular location.\n\n**When to use:**\nUse this to characterize the wind climatology of a site. It is critical for siting\nwind turbines, designing airport runways, and understanding the dispersion of\npollutants from a local source.\n\n**How to read:**\n*   **Direction (Circular/Compass):** The \"petals\" point toward the direction from which\n    the wind is blowing.\n*   **Length of Petals:** Indicates the frequency (percentage of time) the wind blows\n    from that direction.\n*   **Color within Petals:** Represents different wind speed categories (e.g., 0-2 m/s,\n    2-5 m/s, etc.).\n*   **Interpretation:** A long petal pointing North indicates that the wind frequently\n    blows from the North. The distribution of colors within that petal shows the\n    distribution of wind speeds for that specific direction.\n"

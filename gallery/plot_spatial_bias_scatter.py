"""
Spatial Bias Scatter Plot
=========================

**What it's for:**
The Spatial Bias Scatter plot visualizes model performance (specifically bias) at
discrete point locations, such as air quality monitoring stations, on a geographic map.

**When to use:**
Use this to identify regional patterns in model errors. For example, it can reveal if
a model consistently over-predicts in urban areas vs. rural areas, or if there is a
systematic bias along a coastline.

**How to read:**
*   **Markers:** Each point on the map represents a specific location (e.g., a station).
*   **Marker Color:** Typically represents the Mean Bias (Model - Observation). A
    diverging colormap (e.g., Blue-White-Red) is often used where red indicates
    over-prediction and blue indicates under-prediction.
*   **Interpretation:** Look for geographic clusters of the same color, which
    suggest localized systematic errors in the model.
